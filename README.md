# tparty

Displays the TP of party members in the party list.
Loosely based on the addon of the same name for Windower 4 by Cliff.

## Settings
- **party_y_offset**: The y offset for the whole party (and first member)
- **member_y_spacing**: The vertical space between party members
- **x_offset**: The x offset of the TP text
- **text_color**: The text color when TP is not full
- **tp_full_color**: The text when TP is full
- **stroke_color**: The text stroke color

## TODO
- Possibly make use of right aligned text if/when Windower 5 implements it
